# OTP-Based Password Reset Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the OTP (One-Time Password) based password reset system. This system provides an alternative to the traditional email link approach, offering a more user-friendly experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Structure

- [app/forgot-password.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/forgot-password.js) - Selection page for reset method
- [app/forgot-password-email.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/forgot-password-email.js) - Traditional email link reset
- [app/otp-password-reset.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/otp-password-reset.js) - OTP-based reset flow

### 2. OTP Reset Flow

The OTP-based reset flow consists of three steps:

1. **Email Verification**: User enters their email address
2. **OTP Verification**: User receives and enters a 6-digit code
3. **Password Reset**: User sets a new password

### 3. Security Considerations

- OTP codes should be time-limited (typically 5-10 minutes)
- Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent abuse
- OTP codes should be single-use
- Secure transmission of OTP codes (email/SMS)

### 4. User Experience

- Clear instructions at each step
- Resend OTP option
- Proper error handling and feedback
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Integration with Firebase

The current implementation simulates the OTP flow. For a production environment, you would need to:

1. Set up a backend service to generate and verify OTP codes
2. Integrate with Firebase Authentication for password updates
3. Implement proper security measures for OTP generation and validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **SMS OTP Support**: Add option to receive OTP via SMS
2. **Time-limited OTPs**: Implement expiration for OTP codes
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add server-side rate limiting for OTP requests
4. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Extend to support MFA
