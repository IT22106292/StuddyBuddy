# Fix for Profile Page Not Loading After Google Login

## Issue Description

When users sign in with Google, the profile page was not loading because their user profile document was not automatically created in Firestore, unlike when signing up with email/password.

## Root Cause

The application was designed to create user profiles in Firestore only during the email/password signup process. When users sign in with Google, Firebase Authentication creates the user account, but no corresponding document is created in the "users" collection in Firestore.

The profile page was trying to fetch user data from a document that didn't exist, causing it to fail to load.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Profile Page ([app/profile.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/profile.js))

- Added a `createInitialProfile` function that creates a basic user profile for Google sign-in users
- Modified `fetchUserProfile` to check if a user document exists, and if not, create one with default values
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Added a retry button in case of failures

### 2. Modified Home Page ([app/home.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/home.js))

- Updated `fetchUserProfile` to also create initial profiles for Google sign-in users
- This ensures the user has a profile document as soon as they navigate to the home page

### 3. Modified Authentication Hook ([hooks/useAuth.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/hooks/useAuth.js))

- Added logic to automatically create user profiles when a user logs in with Google
- This happens in the background when the authentication state changes
- Ensures all users have a profile document regardless of how they sign in

## How It Works

1. When a user signs in with Google, Firebase Authentication creates their account
2. The `onAuthStateChanged` listener in [hooks/useAuth.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/hooks/useAuth.js) checks if a corresponding document exists in the "users" collection
3. If no document exists, it automatically creates one with default values:
   - Email: From Google account
   - Full Name: From Google account display name or email
   - Subjects: Empty array
   - Expertise Level: "beginner"
   - Is Tutor: false
   - Rating: 0
   - Students Count: 0
   - Created At: Current date
   - Profile Complete: false

4. When users navigate to the profile page, it can now successfully fetch their profile data
5. Users can edit their profile information and save it to complete their profile

## Benefits

- Seamless experience for Google sign-in users
- No manual intervention required
- Consistent user data structure across all sign-in methods
- Users can immediately access their profile and other features

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:
- New Google sign-in users (profile automatically created)
- Existing email/password users (no change in behavior)
- Users with existing profiles (no change in behavior)

All users can now access their profile page regardless of how they signed up or logged in.
