## Resolving the 400 Error

The 400 error you're experiencing is typically caused by one of these issues:

### 1. Incorrect Client ID
Make sure the client ID in your [.env](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/.env) file matches what's registered in the Google Cloud Console.

### 2. Unauthorized Redirect URI
The redirect URI used by Expo isn't authorized in the Google Cloud Console.

### 3. Missing Firebase Configuration
Google Sign-In isn't properly enabled in Firebase Authentication.

## Steps to Fix the Issue

### Step 1: Verify Google OAuth Client ID
1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Project Settings > General
4. Under "Your apps", find your web app
5. Copy the Web client ID

### Step 2: Update Your Environment Variables
In your [.env](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/.env) file, make sure the client ID is correct:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_web_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Step 3: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase
1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Click on Google and enable it
3. Add your project's support email

### Step 4: Add Authorized Domains
1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Scroll to "Authorized domains"
3. Add `localhost` if it's not already there

### Step 5: Restart Your Development Server
1. Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear the Expo cache: `npx expo start -c`
3. Restart your development server: `npx expo start`
