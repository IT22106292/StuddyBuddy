{
  "email-verification": "app/email-verification.js"
}
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

Ensure Firebase Authentication is properly configured:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Make sure "Email/Password" is enabled
3. Check that email templates are properly configured

### 3. Email Template Customization (Optional)

You can customize the verification email template:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates
2. Click on "Email address verification" template
3. Customize the content as needed

## Testing the Flow

4. Verify you're redirected to email verification screen
5. Check your email for verification message
6. Click verification link
7. Click "I've Verified My Email - Continue" button
8. Verify you're redirected to home screen

### Test Signin Without Verification

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Verification Email Not Received
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email address is correct
- Try with different email provider
- Check Firebase Console for delivery issues

### Verification Link Not Working
- Ensure Firebase action URLs are properly configured
- Check that the domain is authorized in Firebase Authentication
- For local development, ensure `localhost` is in authorized domains

### User Stuck on Verification Screen
- Make sure user actually clicks the verification link in their email
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing the page after verifying email

## Security Considerations

- Email verification prevents fake accounts
- Users cannot access the app without verifying their email
- Verification links expire after a certain period
- Rate limiting on resend email requests prevents abuse

## Customization Options

### Modify Verification Screen
- Update styles in [app/email-verification.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/email-verification.js)
- Add additional instructions or branding
- Modify countdown timer duration

### Change Verification Requirements
- Adjust when verification is required
- Add additional verification steps
- Implement SMS verification as a backup

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update action URLs in Firebase Authentication
2. Configure your domain in Firebase settings
3. Test the entire flow with real email addresses
4. Monitor email delivery rates
5. Set up alerts for authentication issues
