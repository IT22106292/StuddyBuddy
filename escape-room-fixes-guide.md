# Escape Room Game Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Earned Points Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Success modal only appeared for newly completed levels
- **Fix**: Modified `completeLevel()` function to always show earned points and badge
- **Result**: Success modal now appears every time you complete a level

### 2. ✅ **Next Level Not Unlocking**
- **Problem**: Level unlocking logic wasn't working properly
- **Fix**: Improved currentLevel calculation and added proper fallback values
- **Result**: Completing a level now properly unlocks the next level

### 3. ✅ **Progress Not Refreshing**
- **Problem**: Main escape room screen didn't refresh after completing a level
- **Fix**: Added `useFocusEffect` to reload user progress when returning to the screen
- **Result**: Level unlocking is immediately visible when you return to the main screen

## How to Test

### Test 1: Points Display
1. Complete any escape room level
2. ✅ **Expected**: Success modal shows with earned points and badge
3. Complete the same level again
4. ✅ **Expected**: Success modal still shows with points (even if already completed)

### Test 2: Level Unlocking
1. Complete Level 1 (Science Lab Escape)
2. ✅ **Expected**: Level 2 (Treasure Vault) becomes available
3. Return to main escape room screen
4. ✅ **Expected**: Level 2 shows as "available" instead of "locked"
5. ✅ **Expected**: You can tap and enter Level 2

### Test 3: Progress Tracking
1. Complete any level
2. ✅ **Expected**: Progress bar updates
3. ✅ **Expected**: "X / 5 Levels" counter increases
4. ✅ **Expected**: Total points increase
5. ✅ **Expected**: Badge appears in badges section

## Debug Information

The console will now show debug messages:
- `Level X completed! Unlocking level Y` - when a new level is completed
- `Level already completed, showing completion modal` - for repeat completions

## Key Code Changes

1. **Always Show Success Modal**: Modified to show completion rewards regardless of previous completion
2. **Better Level Unlocking**: Fixed `currentLevel` calculation with proper fallbacks
3. **Auto-Refresh**: Added focus effect to update progress when returning from levels
4. **User Feedback**: Added hint about next level being unlocked
5. **Error Handling**: Improved validation and error messages
