# Firestore Rules Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Firebase CLI installed
2. Logged into Firebase account with appropriate permissions
3. Project initialized with Firebase

## Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended)

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in your project directory
2. Run the following command to deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### Method 2: Using Firebase Console

1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Firestore Database â†’ Rules tab
4. Copy the contents of `firestore.rules` file from your project
5. Paste the rules into the editor
6. Click "Publish"

## Verification

After deployment, test the deletion functionality in your app:
1. Try selecting a message and deleting it for yourself only
2. Try selecting your own message and deleting it for everyone
3. Check that the console logs show proper success messages

## Common Issues

### 1. Permission Denied Errors
If you see "PERMISSION_DENIED" errors in the console:
- Ensure you've deployed the updated rules
- Verify your user account has proper authentication
- Check that the rules match the actual data structure in your database

### 2. Rules Not Taking Effect
If changes don't seem to take effect:
- Wait a few minutes after deployment (rules can take time to propagate)
- Try refreshing your app completely
- Check the Firebase Console to confirm rules were updated

### 3. Still Seeing "Selected messages count: 0"
This indicates a state management issue:
- Ensure you're using the latest version of the app with the fixes
- Check that the `newSelected` set is being used correctly in state updates
- Verify that the component is properly re-rendering after state changes
