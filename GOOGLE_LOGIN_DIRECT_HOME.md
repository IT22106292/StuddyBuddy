# Google Login Direct to Home Page

## Summary

This document explains how Google login users are now directed directly to the home page without any intermediate role selection screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sign-In Page ([app/signin.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/signin.js))

- Reverted the Google authentication success handler to directly redirect to the home page
- Removed the profile completion check that was previously used to determine if a user should be redirected to role selection
- Simplified the Google sign-in flow to match the email/password sign-in flow

### 2. Authentication Hook ([hooks/useAuth.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/hooks/useAuth.js))

- Modified the initial profile creation for Google login users to mark profiles as complete by default
- This ensures that Google login users are treated the same as email/password signup users

### 3. Profile Page ([app/profile.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/profile.js))

- Updated the initial profile creation to mark profiles as complete by default
- Ensures consistency across all user creation paths

### 4. Home Page ([app/home.js](file:///d:/StuddyBuddy/app/home.js))

- Updated the initial profile creation to mark profiles as complete by default
- Ensures consistency across all user creation paths

## How It Works

1. When a user signs in with Google, Firebase Authentication handles the authentication
2. The system checks if a user profile exists in Firestore
3. If not, it creates one with default values and marks it as complete
4. The user is immediately redirected to the home page
5. No role selection screen is shown

## Benefits

- Simplified user experience for Google login users
- Consistent behavior between email/password and Google login users
- Faster onboarding process
- No additional steps required for Google login users

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- New Google login users (profile automatically created, directed to home)
- Existing Google login users (existing profile used, directed to home)
- Email/password login users (no change in behavior)

All users now have a consistent experience regardless of their sign-in method.
